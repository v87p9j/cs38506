Summary: This assignment asks you to research and then design a “virtual/electronic conference
poster” that outlines the use of “two-eyed seeing” (aka blended Indigenous/Western Science approaches) in a specific case study example of resource management. It is important to note that there are many examples of two-eyed seeing that never use the term two-eyed seeing (two-eyed seeing is often used within a specific First Nations context in North America, but there are many other examples where the same concept is applied with so-called ‘traditional peoples’/Indigenous peoples. This is often referred to   as "blended knowledge" or simply combined Scientific/Traditional knowledge). Lectures on October 1st  and Guest Lecture on October 3rd  in Week 5 give you more understanding of the concept. Please attend my office hours or speak tome after class if you need help identifying a case study or want to check to make sure the case study you  have identified is appropriate. 
Format: e-poster (poster size: A4), formatted as you would expect to see in an academic conference (some examples shown and discussed in Week-1 class)
Overview and instructions: You will search for documentation about a specific resource
management case study example (project,program, protected area, landscape, project initiative,a specific type of resource, etc.) anywhere in the world where two-eyed seeing has formed a significant part of the overall management approach. You will first give enough context about your case study example so that the reader will be able to understand your subsequent analysis. You will then analyze and explain to the reader how two-eyed seeing has affected the overall management of your case study.
Youre-poster should include: 
•   Introduction
o Provide a brief introduction about your poster topic and its significance.
o A good poster contains a concise introduction section with a broader overview of the problem.
•    Overview of your case study example
o Provide a brief overview of what your case study comprises, where it is located, who the major actors are in your case, etc.
o A good poster consists of a specific overview instead of trying to include all background stories.
•   Explanation of how two-eyed seeing affects the management of your case study
o Provide an in-depth explanation of how the two-eyed seeing approach contributes to the management of your case study resources /in your case study area.
o You can use maps/images/charts/figures where relevant to support your explanation.
o Make sure you provide the name and source of maps/images/charts/figures you have used in your poster.
o A good poster links/explains the idea from maps/images/charts/figures used in your poster into the text rather than keeping it stand-alone.
•    Conclusions
o Explain what you can conclude about the benefits and challenges of using two-eyed seeing for your resource management case.
o A good poster has a succinct conclusion section instead of restating the same thing from the previous sections.
•   List of references
o You need to provide at least three academic sources including journal articles. However,you are encouraged to consider more resources.
o Provide an alphabetical listing of all sources used (can be in smaller font BUT legible if you are worried about the space).
o Be sure to cite sources using APA or a comparable style.
You can improve the overall style. of your poster by being thoughtful about: 
o Presentation (use of graphics, distinc代 写GEOG 356: Resources Management Assignment 2
代做程序编程语言t headings, etc.).
o Poster “impact” (e.g. colour, contrast, separation between sections, graphic elements which increase impact).
o Supporting figures/tables/maps/photos.
o Idea development (logic, sequence, continuity, structure, grammar, sentence construction, word choice, etc.).
o Citations (i.e., cite all materials as you would a research paper. Endnotes have been recommended to clarify some ideas in the poster’s main text).

Proficient (8-10) 

1. Introduction (10 marks) 
Generally, a poor introduction 
Either the reader is not eased into the topic OR does not 
know the poster will address two-eyed seeing The reader is eased into the topic and knows the poster will address two-eyed seeing 


Beginning (0-7) 
Developing (7-11) 
Proficient (11-15) 

2. Case study example 
overview (15 marks) 
Very poorly done/far too brief 
Good overview - the reader is given some info but perhaps not enough to fully 
understand the case study 
Excellent overview – the reader is given enough 
information to understand the case study 


Beginning (0-12) 
Developing (12-17) 
Proficient (18-24) 
Exemplary (25-30) 
3.   Explanation of how two-eyed seeing affects the 
management of your case study 
(30 marks) 
Very poorly done all 
around, not at a third year University standard! 
Fair text explanation of how two-eyed seeing contributes 
to management (and 
maps/images/charts/figures are used where relevant) but many elements not discussed Good text explanation of how two-eyed seeing contributes to management (and 
maps/images/charts/figures are used where relevant) but perhaps not a complete
